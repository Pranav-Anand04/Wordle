# Wordle Project created by Pranav Anand on December 28 2023
# This project was inspired by the Wordle website and uses font awesome for icons.

#### Description
This project is a game where the user has 6 tries to guess a 5 letter word. If the user guesses the right word then game will end and 
the user will be given the word and option to play again. If the user is unable to give the right answer on the 6 tries then the user
will be given the correct word and option to play again. This game not only is fun but will help you gain knowledge of new words.
The users also has option to read the help menue incase they are confused on how to play and dark/light mode depending on their choice.
This project also uses arrays to to store the word in the correct tile and after submit if it is at right spot they will be given green
tile. If it is in the word but not correct spot then a yellow tile and if it is worng then a gray tile. We add the colors of the tile 
by DOM manipulation by adding classes. 

Thank you.
